This building was one of the first after RIT moved to Henrietta from downtown Rochester. #speaker:Eastman

Despite this, there’s always something new to see in Eastman. #speaker:Eastman

Tired of your dusty cafeteria food? Try Henry’s in the fourth floor of the Eastman building! #speaker:Eastman

It’s only open for a limited amount of time a year. #speaker:Eastman

This is because it is used for menu and restaurant management in the hospitality program! #speaker:Eastman
