In the spring and prior to the temperatures dropping, you can see koi fish in the Eastman Kodak Quad! #speaker:KoiPond

The koi fish depicts good fortune for the ever-growing nature of the garden. #speaker:KoiPond

The garden was made to memorialize Yasuji Tojo. #speaker:KoiPond

He was an international student from Japan who studied photography at RIT. #speaker:KoiPond

He unfortunately passed away in 1964 due to an automobile accident. #speaker:KoiPond

As a result, this garden was created to represent “eternal youth.” #speaker:KoiPond
